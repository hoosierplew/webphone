# WebPhone

## SOW: Design the interface for a web-based phone
The user needs to be able to initiate and receive calls to any phone number or contact. They should also be able to listen to any voice messages left for them. A large portion of the user base will use the phone in areas with poor internet connection reliability and may experience disconnected calls at a higher than normal rate.

## Deliverables
Deliverables include any written thoughts, sketches and/or wireframes created during this process.

### Inspirations

#### Skype

##### - [x] Initiate and receive calls to any phone number or contact (_desktop browser only_)

Skype allows its users to initiate and receive calls to any phone number or contact by providing a dialpad within the browser for calls. Users can import contacts from several social media channels by searching contacts within those channels for associated Skype accounts.

Interestingly, Skype does not support browser-based usage of its services within a tablet or mobile device. Users must use the Skype app available for that device.

##### - [x] Listen to any voice messages left for them (_desktop browser only_)

Skype offers both voice and video messaging via a chat window associated with a contact. Users who pay for a subscription have access to a phone number with the ability to listen to voice messages from that number within the Skype environment.

#### Google Voice

##### - [] Initiate and receive calls to any phone number or contact (_phone browser only_)

Google Voice allows users to send and receive calls from any phone number, but only allows Google Contacts data to be used for looking up contacts. Other avenues for finding contact information (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, etc) are not available.

Google Voice's phone calling system is different from desktop to mobile device. For desktop users, Google Voice allows the user to initiate a call and send it to either their mobile device or to Google Hangouts. The user then leaves the Google Voice environment to complete the call.

##### - [x] Listen to any voice messages left for them

Voicemails sent to the user's Google Voice phone number are available in-app.

### Approach

WebPhone will be developed as a fully responsive web-based application, taking advantage of the latest available web APIs including [Notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API) and [Web Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API) to delver a web-based telephony application that will be accessible from a browser on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

WebPhone will offer integrations with an array of existing social and professional media applications for importing contact information to allow for initiation of phone calls with anyone.
