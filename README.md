# WebPhone

## SOW: Design the interface for a web-based phone
The user needs to be able to initiate and receive calls to any phone number or contact. They should also be able to listen to any voice messages left for them. A large portion of the user base will use the phone in areas with poor internet connection reliability and may experience disconnected calls at a higher than normal rate.
