# WebPhone

## SOW: Design the interface for a web-based phone
The user needs to be able to initiate and receive calls to any phone number or contact. They should also be able to listen to any voice messages left for them. A large portion of the user base will use the phone in areas with poor internet connection reliability and may experience disconnected calls at a higher than normal rate.

## Deliverables
Deliverables inclued any written thoughts, sketches and/or wireframes created during this process.

### Deliverable 1: Inspirations

#### Skype

- [x] Initiate and receive calls to any phone number or contact (_desktop browser only_)

Skype allows its users to initiate and receive calls to any phone number or contact by providing a dialpad within the browser for calls. Users can import contacts from several social media channels by searching contacts within those channels for associated Skype accounts.

Interestingly, Skype does not support browser-based usage of its services within a tablet or smartphone. Users must use the Skype app available for that device.

- [x] Listen to any voice messages left for them (_desktop browser only_)

Skype offers both voice and video messaging via a chat window associated with a contact. Users who pay for a subscription have access to a phone number with the ability to listen to voice messages from that number within the Skype environment.
